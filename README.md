# DigitagrizeIt Web App - Web Information Systems
The technological development in the field of agricultural production and cultivation in recent years has been rapid, in terms of the improvement of the tools and machinery used, which makes the life of farmers much easier as it allows the cultivation of large areas with much less effort .

On the other hand, the way in which the production/cultivation is available and the interaction with the intermediaries is done remains quite "traditional", especially when we refer to producers with smaller areas and with different types of crops or in quite remote areas.

There is also a phenomenon of areas of land that are not cultivated mainly due to financial difficulties, so the need for bilateral cooperation is created, with one party providing the land and labor and the other party providing the capital.
 
“Digitagrize it!” is an application within the framework of "Make it digital" that allows farmers/producers to be able to promote their production through the platform to a larger audience than is currently possible in more traditional ways or to allocate land that they do not farm for investment/shareholding. Accordingly, it also allows importers/exporters or middlemen to more easily search for suppliers or investors to search for available land for cultivation and joint exploitation with the owner.
